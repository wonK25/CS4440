18,escaped prisoner report ordered first minister jack mcconnell has ordered a report on the decision to allow a paranoid schizophrenic knife attacker to go on a visit unguarded michael ferguson 36 escaped after being allowed out of the highsecurity carstairs unit the snps nicola sturgeon has demanded to know who was responsible for signing off the leave the scottish executive said ministers would be notified but it would not be common practice to sign approval an executive spokesman said the health department and the state hospital itself would work together on preparing the report ministerial responsibility for carstairs rests with rhona brankin the deputy health minister ms brankin said the first minister has called for a review of what has happened we need to talk to the state hospital and we need to reflect on this ms sturgeon has written to mr mcconnell asking for clarification on the move to allow the prisoner out she said questions must be answered about his escape if the public is to be reassured about safety police are still searching for ferguson who failed to return after a trip to east kilbride on monday the scottish national partys parliamentary leader argued that under the law authorisation of fergusons leave of absence would have come directly from ministers she said the scottish executive seemed to indicate yesterday that the escape of mr ferguson was a matter for carstairs however my understanding is that under the mental health legislation the decision to grant this patient and any restricted patient leave of absence would have required direct and specific authorisation by scottish ministers she added i have written to the first minister today asking for confirmation of that fact i have also asked him to confirm which minister would routinely take decisions of this nature and what information they are based on this is not an attempt to apportion blame but to ensure a better understanding of the decision making process in such important and sensitive cases police said ferguson posed a danger to the public bbc scotland political correspondent glenn campbell said the first minister had ordered an urgent report into the situation he said we understand from the executive that in this case no individual minister signed off the approval for michael ferguson to be released unescorted from carstairs the executive concedes that it is up to scottish ministers they have a legal responsibility for approving this sort of leave but they say routinely it is specialised officials that make that decision and simply inform ministers that they have taken it but at that stage presumably ministers can ask hard questions and can ask for reassurances that the patient is not a serious danger to the public or that any risk has been minimised scottish conservative leader david mcletchie said earlier it was almost beyond belief that this has been allowed to happen the executive spokeswoman said the recommendation for leave was agreed by a psychiatric advisor in conjunction with officials on behalf of ministers she said ministers were told of that notified of it but it would not be common practice for them to sign it off they do have statutory responsibility but the common practice has been that people who work with the patient and have the best knowledge about risk would make that decision ferguson who slashed a man in a doctors surgery in coatbridge in 1994 had been out to see his fianc233e annabella holmes 47 whom he met when she was a patient at the high security complex in south lanarkshire he is described as being 5ft 9ins tall slim with blond hair blue eyes and a fair complexion ferguson was wearing a black jacket grey jeans black jumper and black shoes when he was last seen he has multiple fading tattoos on his left hand and a very faded tear tattoo under his left eye ms holmes is not missing but there have been no sightings of ferguson since monday strathclyde police asked anyone who spots ferguson to contact sergeant keith mcdonald on

37,how political squabbles snowball its become commonplace to argue that blair and brown are like squabbling school kids and that they and their supporters need to grow up and stop bickering but this analysis in fact gets it wrong its not just children who fight adults do too and there are solid reasons why even a trivial argument between mature protagonists can be hard to stop once its got going the key feature of an endless feud is that everyone can agree theyd be better off if it ended but everyone wants to have the last word each participant genuinely wants the row to stop but thinks it worth prolonging the argument just a tiny bit to ensure their view is heard their successive attempts to end the argument with their last word ensure the argument goes on and on and on in the case of mr blair and mr brown successive books are published ensuring the issues never die now this isnt because the participants are stupid its actually each individual behaving entirely rationally given the incentives facing them indeed theres even a piece of economic theory that explains all this nothing as obscure as postneoclassical endogenous growth theory which the chancellor himself once quoted but a ubiquitous piece of game theory which all respectable policy wonks are familiar with its often referred to as the prisoners dilemma based on a parable much told in economics degree courses about a sheriff and two prisoners the story goes that two prisoners are jointly charged with a heinous crime and are locked up in separate cells but the sheriff desperately needs a confession from at least one of them to provide enough evidence to convict them of the crime without a confession the prisoners will get a minimal sentence on some trumped up charge clearly the prisoners best strategy is to keep their mouths shut and take the short sentence but the clever sheriff has an idea to induce them to talk he tells each prisoner separately that if they confess and they are the only one to confess theyll be let off their crime and he tells them that if they dont confess and they are the only one not to confess theyll get life now if you are prisoner confronted with this choice your best bet is to confess if your partner doesnt confess youll get off completely and if your partner does confess youd better confess to ensure you dont get life the result is of course both prisoners confess so the sheriff does not have to let either one off both prisoners individual logic was to behave that way even though both would have been better if they had somehow agreed to shut up dont worry if you dont entirely follow it you can to look it up on google where there are 283000 entries on it the prisoners dilemma and all its ramifications have truly captured economists in the last couple of decades it is a parable used to describe any situation where there is an obvious sensible choice to be taken collectively but where the only rational choice individually is to behave selfishly a cold war arms race for example a classic case where both russia and america would be better off with just a few arms rather than a lot of arms but as long as each wants just a few more arms than the other an arms race ensues with the results that the individually logical decision to buy more arms results in arms levels that are too high what economics tells us is that once youre in a prisoners dilemma unless you are repeating the experience many times over its hard to escape the perverse logic of it its no good just exhorting people to stop buying arms or to stop arguing when all their incentives encourage them to carry on somehow the incentives have to change in the case of the labour party if you believe the rift between blair and brown camps is as bad as the reports suggest solomons wisdom needs to be deployed to solve the problem every parent knows there are ingenious solutions to arguments solutions which affect the incentives of the participants an example is the famous rule that one divides the other chooses as a way of allocating a piece of cake to be sliced up between greedy children in the case of an apparently endless argument if you want it to come to an end you have to ensure the person who has the last word is one who loses rather than the one who wins the row the cost of prolonging the row by even one more briefing or one more book for that matter has to exceed the benefit of having the last word and getting your point in if the rest of the party can enforce that theyll have the protagonists retreating pretty quickly

91,dallaglio his own man to the end controversy and lawrence dallaglio have never been very far away from each other throughout a glittering international career even the end of his nineyear career came out of the blue just four days before the start of the season but then dallaglio has always been his own man ever since emerging onto the international scene dallaglio has polarised opinions to supporters of england dallaglio could do no wrong an integral part of a sustained period of success for england dallaglios crowning glory was his part in the side that won the rugby world cup in 2003 rival fans meanwhile have tended to take an alternative view seeing dallaglio as the epitome of the less agreeable characteristics of english rugby never afraid to speak his mind be it to the referee or the opposition on the pitch or his coach or the media off it dallaglio has sometimes rubbed people up the wrong way dallaglio arrived as part of the unheralded england side which became the shock winners of the first rugby sevens world cup in 1993 it took him another two years to graduate to the full england xv but once there he proved to the manor born displaying maturity and physical power beyond his years dallaglio rapidly established himself as an automatic choice able to play any one of the three backrow positions at international standard within two years of his debut dallaglio was offered the england captains band and his career continued to go from strength to strength as he made the 1997 lions tour to south africa although overlooked for the captaincy in favour of england teammate martin johnson he played a massive role in the 21 series victory but after building up a seemingly unstoppable momentum dallaglios career hit the buffers at speed in 1999 first came the lastminute defeat to wales in which dallaglios decision not to kick for goal in the dying minutes was blamed for costing england a grand slam worse was to follow though as an infamous newspaper sting cost him his treasured england captaincy with sensational allegations of drug use of which he was subsequently cleared splashed across the front pages a devastated dallaglio stepped down as england skipper but he bounced back getting his head down at club level before returning to the england fold albeit now as a lieutenant to new captain johnson as a member of a newlook england side on the long road to world cup glory a journey not without mishaps as a succession of grand slams opportunities were spurned dallaglio emerged as a key performer once again yet another setback arrived in 2001 as a serious knee injury cut short dallaglios involvement on the lions tour to australia rumours began to circulate that his career was over but in typical dallaglio style he embarked on a punishing schedule of rehabilitation to return an even more fearsome physical specimen one effect of the injury was to rob dallaglio of much of his pace but ever the pragmatist he reinvented himself as a close quarters number eight of the highest calibre the only player to play every minute of englands world cup triumph in australia dallaglio could hardly have done more to secure englands historic win and for that he will always be held in the highest esteem by england supporters following johnsons retirement dallaglios career came full circle as woodward restored him as england captain while england did not hit the heights in dallaglios second spell as captain losing five of their eight postworld cup tests dallaglio led by example leaving him as one of the few members of a squad lacking many world cup stars to live up to expectations dallaglio walks away from the international game safe in the knowledge that he will go down as one of englands most accomplished players if not one of the great captains despite his evident pride in leading his country the problem now for england is how to replace the almost irreplaceable the likes of matt dawson jonny wilkinson phil vickery and hill have all been mentioned as contenders for dallaglios role as captain but it is as a player that england will really struggle to replace the 32yearold although players like joe worsley and chris jones are more than capable of stepping up the fact that there is no standout candidate speaks volumes about dallaglios massive influence on english rugby

103,williams stays on despite dispute matt williams insists he has no thoughts of quitting as national coach as a result of the power struggle currently gripping scottish rugby the chairman chief executive and three nonexecutive directors all departed in a row over the games future direction but williams said i want to make it clear that im committed totally to scottish rugby ive brought my family here and weve immersed ourselves in scottish life theres no way that im walking away however he attempted to steer clear of taking sides in the dispute id like to stress that the national team is separate to the political situation he said when you come to an undertaking like this and you are trying to make a difference then there are always people who will begrudge you who are jealous and want to try to drag you down when you have that situation you have to have the courage of your convictions to see it through there was some very unhelpful and uninformed comment that the national team had received a massive increase in budget at the expense of other parts of scottish rugby and that is simply not the case like all good coaches you go and ask for an increase but we were told in no uncertain terms that the financial situation did not allow that the idea that we are lighting cigars with 20 notes while the rest of scottish rugby flounders is absolutely untrue we also attracted criticism because of the number of days players spent with the national team but let me give you the truth our irish counterparts whom we have to compete with in a few days time had 70 days together at the summer they are currently in camp now and they will have another 21 days in camp before the six nations that means they will have 91 days away from their club from july until the six nations we on the other hand will have 16 there must be a winwin philosophy and attitude within scottish rugby and that is what we are after both groups winning not competing

175,net regulation still possible the blurring of boundaries between tv and the internet raises questions of regulation watchdog ofcom has said content on tv and the internet is set to move closer this year as tvquality video online becomes a norm at a debate in westminster the net industry considered the options lord currie chairman of superregulator ofcom told the panel that protecting audiences would always have to be a primary concern for the watchdog despite having no remit for the regulation of net content disquiet has increased among internet service providers as speeches made by ofcom in recent months hinted that regulation might be an option at the debate organised by the internet service providers association ispa lord currie did not rule out the possibility of regulation the challenge will arise when boundaries between tv and the internet truly blur and then there is a balance to be struck between protecting consumers and allowing them to assess the risks themselves he said adopting the rules that currently exist to regulate tv content or selfregulation which is currently the practice of the net industry will be up for discussion some studies suggest that as many as eight million households in the uk could have adopted broadband by the end of 2005 and the technology opens the door to tv content delivered over the net more and more internet service providers and media companies are streaming video content on the web bt has already set up an entertainment division to create and distribute content that could come from sources such as bskyb itv and the bbc head of the division andrew burke spoke about the possibility of creating content for all platforms how risque can i be in this new age with celebrity chefs serving up more expletives than hot dinners surely i can push it to the limit he said in fact he said if content has been requested by consumers and they have gone to lengths to download it then maybe it should be entirely regulation free internet service providers have long claimed no responsibility for the content they carry on their servers since the law commission dubbed them mere conduits back in 2002 this defence does not apply if they have actual knowledge of illegal content and have failed to remove it the level of responsibility they have has been tested in several highprofile legal cases richard ayers portal director at tiscali said there was little point trying to regulate the internet because it would be impossible huge changes are afoot in 2005 he predicted as companies such as the bbc offer tv content over the net the bbcs planned interactive media player which will give surfers the chance to download programmes such as eastenders and top gear will make net tv mainstream and raise a whole new set of questions he said one of these will be about the vast sums of money involved in maintaining the network to supply such a huge quantity of data and could herald a new digital licence fee said mr ayers as inappropriate net content most obviously pornography viewed by children continues to dominate the headlines internet regulation remains a political issue said mp richard allan liberal democrat spokesman on it mr allan thinks that the answer could lie somewhere between the cries of impossible to regulate and just apply offline laws online in fact instead of seeing regulation brought online the future could bring an end to regulation as we know it for all tv content after lord currie departed the panel agreed that this could be a reality and that for the internet people power is likely to reign if content is ondemand consumers have pulled it up rather than had pushed to them then it is the consumers choice to watch it there is no watershed on the net said mr burke
176,video phone help for deaf people deaf people who prefer to communicate using british sign language bsl could soon be having their phone conversations relayed using webcams or videophones and an interpreter the video relay service is being piloted by the royal national institute for deaf people rnid but the organisation says unless the service is provided at the same rate as voice calls it will be beyond most peoples pockets the rnid is urging telecoms regulator ofcom to reduce the cost of the service from the current 700 per minute and make it the same as ordinary phone calls the service works by putting a deaf person in visual contact with a bsl interpreter via a webcam or video phone and the interpreter then relays the deaf persons conversation using a telephone and translates the other persons response into sign language for many deaf people especially those born deaf bsl is a first and preferred means of communication until now the only alternative has been to use textphones which means having to type a message and have it relayed via an operator in the past ive used textphones but they have problems said robert currington who is taking part in the pilot i communicate in bsl my written english is not very good and it takes me longer to think in english and type my message i sometimes find it difficult to understand the reply the rnid says the uk is lagging behind other countries which are already making relay services available at the cost of an ordinary phone call there are no technical or economic reasons for not providing equivalent access to services for deaf people said rnid technology director guido gybels in the us and australia sign language relay services have already been made universally available at the same cost as a voice call by failing to provide and fund the video relay service for sign language users the telecommunications sector is effectively discriminating against an already disenfranchised group ofcom says it has plans to review the services that telecoms companies are obliged to provide early next year and new technology including the video relay service will be discussed with interested parties in the near future but a spokesman said its powers were limited by legislation any proposals to extend existing arrangements to cover new services would be for government to consider he said mr currington like many of the uks 70000 bsl users will be hoping that a way can be found to make a costeffective service available the relay service makes phone conversations a pleasure he said i can show my emotions more easily in bsl in the same way hearing people express emotions through voice calls
177,concerns over windows atms cash machine networks could soon be more susceptible to computer viruses a security firm has warned the warning is being issued because many banks are starting to use the windows operating system in machines already there have been four incidents in which windows viruses have disrupted networks of cash machines running the microsoft operating system but banking experts say the danger is being overplayed and that the risks of infection and disruption are small for many years the venerable ibm operating system known as os2 has been the staple software used to power many of the 14m cash machines in operation around the world but ibm will end support for os2 in 2006 which is forcing banks to look for alternatives there are also other pressures making banks turn to windows said dominic hirsch managing director of financial analysis firm retail banking research he said many cash machines will also have to be upgraded to make full use of the new europay mastercard and visa credit cards that use computer chips instead of magnetic stripes to store data us laws that demand disabled people get equal access to information will also force banks to make their cash machines more versatile and able to present information in different ways todd thiemann spokesman for antivirus firm trend micro said the move to windows in cash machines was not without risks mr thiemann said research by the towergroup showed that 70 of new cash machines being installed were windows based already he said there have been four incidents in which cash machines have been unavailable for hours due to viruses affecting the network of the bank that owns them in january 2003 the slammer worm knocked out 13000 cash machines of the bank of america and many of those operated by the canadian imperial bank of commerce in august of the same year cash machines of two unnamed banks were put out of action for hours following an infection by the welchia worm incidents like this happen said mr thiemann because when banks start using windows cash machines they also change the networking technology used to link the devices to their back office computers this often means that all the cash machines and computers in a bank share the same data network this could mean that cash machines get caught up in the viruses that are going around because they have a common transmission system he said banks need to consider protection as part of the investment to maintain the security of that network mr thiemann told bbc news online but mr hirsch from retail banking research said the number of cash machines actually at risk was low because so few were upgraded every year currently he said a cash machine has a lifetime of up to 10 years which means that only about 10 of all atms get swapped for a newer model every year windows cash machines have been around for several years he said most banks simply upgrade as part of their usual replacement cycle in theory there is a bigger threat with windows than os2 he said but i do not think that the banks are hugely concerned at the moment its pretty unusual to hear about virus problems with atms he said the many different security systems builtin to cash machines meant there was no chance that a virus could cause them to start spitting out cash spontaneously he said banks were more likely to be worried about internal networks being overwhelmed by worms and viruses and customers not being able to get cash out at all he added a spokesman for the association of payment and clearing services apacs which represents the uks payments industry said the risk from viruses was minimal theres no concern that theres going to be any type of virus hitting the uk networks he said risks of infection were small because the data networks that connect uk cash machines together and the operators of the atms themselves were a much smaller and tightlyknit community than in the us where viruses have struck
178,cabs collect mountain of mobiles gadgets are cheaper smaller and more common than ever but that just means we are more likely to lose them in london alone over the past six months more than 63000 mobile phones have been left in the back of black cabs according to a survey that works out at about three phones per cab over the same period almost 5000 laptops and 5800 pdas such as palms and pocket pcs were left in licensed cabs even the great and good are not immune to losing their beloved gadgets jemima khan reportedly left her ipod phone and purse in a cab and asked for them to be returned to her friend who turned out to be hugh grant as the popularity of portable gadgets has grown and we trust more of our lives to them we seem to be forgetting them in ever larger numbers the numbers of lost laptops has leapt by 71 in the last three years this has left londoners or those travelling by cab in the capital as the worlds best at losing laptops according to the research by the licensed taxi drivers association and pointsec a mobiledata backup firm more than twice as many laptops were left in the back of black cabs in london as in any of the nine other cities helsinki oslo munich paris stockholm copenhagen chicago and sydney where the research into lost and found gadgets was carried out by contrast danes were most adept at losing mobile phones being seven times more likely to leave it behind in a cab than travellers in germans norwegians and swedes top of the range phones can carry enormous amounts of data enough to hold hundreds of pictures or thousands of contact details given that few people back up the data on their pc it is a fair bet that even fewer do so with the phone they carry around you could be losing a fair chunk of your life in the back of that cab not least because many people collect numbers on their phone that they do not have anywhere else equally phones let you navigate through contacts by name so many people have completely forgotten their friends numbers and could not reconstruct them if they had to this growing habit of losing gadgets explains the rise of firms such as retrofone which lets people buy a cheap oldfashioned phone to replace the tiny shiny expensive one they have just lost britons growing love of phones has also led to the creation of the mobile equipment national database that lets you register the unique id number of your phone so it can be returned to you in the event of it being lost or stolen according to statistics 50 of all muggings and snatch theft offences involve mobiles millions of gadgets are now logged in the database and organisations such as transport for london regularly consult it when trying to reunite folk with their phones and other gadgets for the drivers finding a mobile in the back of their cab is one of the more pleasant things many have found the survey of what else has been left behind included a harp a dog a hamster and a baby
179,mobiles rack up 20 years of use mobile phones in the uk are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend britains first mobile phone call was made across the vodafone network on 1 january 1985 by veteran comedian ernie wise in the 20 years since that day mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90 of britons own a handset mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline the first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in new york but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched the uk was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked the first call was made from st katherines dock to vodafones head office in newbury which at the time was over a curry house for the first nine days of 1985 vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the uk then on 10 january cellnet now o2 launched its service mike caudwell spokesman for vodafone said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase cost about 2000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes despite that they were hugely popular in the mid80s he said they became a yuppy musthave and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk this was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on he said it took vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only 18 months to get the second million its very easy to forget that in 1983 when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people he said cellnet was forecasting half that now vodafone has 14m customers in the uk alone cellnet and vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the uk until 1993 when one2one now tmobile was launched orange had its uk launch in 1994 both newcomers operated digital mobile networks and now all operators use this technology the analogue spectrum for the old phones has been retired called global system for mobiles gsm this is now the most widely used phone technology on the planet and is used to help more than 12 billion people make calls mr caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular
180,when technology gets personal in 2020 whipping out your mobile phone to make a call will be quaintly pass233 by then phones will be printed directly on to wrists or other parts of the body says ian pearson bts resident futurologist its all part of whats known as a pervasive ambient world where chips are everywhere mr pearson does not have a crystal ball his job is to formulate ideas based on what science and technology are doing now to guide industries into the future inanimate objects will start to interact with us we will be surrounded on streets in homes in appliances on our bodies and possibly in our heads by things that think forget local area networks these will be body area networks ideas about just how smart small or even invisible technology will get are always floating around images of devices clumsily bolted on to heads or wrists have pervaded thinking about future technology but now a new vision is surfacing where smart fabrics and textiles will be exploited to enhance functionality form or aesthetics such materials are already starting to change how gadgets and electronics are used and designed so mp3 players the mass gadget of the moment will disappear and instead become integrated into ones clothing says mr pearson so the gadgets that fill up your handbag when we integrate those into fabric we can actually get rid of all that stuff you wont necessarily see the electronics wearable technology could exploit body heat to charge it up while video tattoos or intelligent electronic contact lenses might function as tv screens for those on the move however this future of highly personal devices where technology is worn or even fuses with the body itself raises ethical questions if technology is going to be increasingly part of clothing jewellery and skin there needs to be some serious thinking about what it means for us as humans says baroness susan greenfield at a recent conference for technology engineering academic and fashion industry experts at the royal society in london neuroscientist baroness greenfield cautioned we cant just sleepwalk into the future yet this technology is already upon us researchers have developed computers and sensors worn in clothing mp3 jackets based on the idea that electrically conductive fabric can connect to keyboard sewn into sleeves have already appeared in shops these smart fabrics have come about through advances in nano and microengineering the ability to manipulate and exploit materials at micro or molecular scale at the nanoscale materials can be tuned to display unusual properties that can be exploited to build faster lighter stronger and more efficient devices and systems the textile and clothing industry has been one of the first to exploit nanotechnology in quite straightforward ways many developments are appearing in real products in the fields of medicine defence healthcare sports and communications professional swimming suits reduce drag by incorporating tiny structures similar to shark skin nanoscale titanium dioxide tio2 coatings give fabrics antibacterial and antiodour properties these have special properties which can be activated in contact with the air or uv light such coatings have already been used to stop socks smelling for instance to turn airline seats into super stainresistant surfaces and applied to windows so they clean themselves dressings for wounds can now incorporate nanoparticles with biocidal properties and smart patches are being developed to deliver drugs through the skin but baroness greenfield is concerned about how far this more personal contact with technology might affect our very being if our clothing skin and personal body networks do the talking and the monitoring everywhere we go we have to think about what that means for our concept of privacy mr pearson picks up the theme pointing out there are a lot of issues humans have to iron out before we become cyborgian his main concern is privacy we are looking at electronics which are really in deep contact with your body and a lot of that information you really dont want every passerby to know so we have to make sure we build security in this if you are wearing smart makeup where electronics are controlling the appearance you dont want people hacking in and writing messages on your forehead as technology infiltrates our biology how will our brains function differently we cannot arrogantly assume that the human brain will not change with this warns baroness greenfield there have already been successful experiments to grow human nerve cells on circuit boards this paves the way for brain implants to help paralysed people interface directly with computers clearly the organic carbon of our bodies and silicon is increasingly merging the cyborg a very familiar parthuman partinorganic science fiction and academic idea is on its way

188,new consoles promise big problems making games for future consoles will require more graphic artists and more money an industry conference has been told sony microsoft and nintendo will debut their new consoles at the annual e3 games expo in los angeles in may these socalled next generation machines will be faster than current consoles and capable of displaying much higherquality visuals for gamers this should make for better more immersive games in a prerecorded video slot during microsofts keynote address at the game developers conference held last week in san francisco famed director james cameron revealed he is making a game in tandem with his next film believed to be battle angel alita the games visual quality would be like a lucid dream said mr cameron but numerous speakers warned that creating such graphics will require more artists and so next generation console games will be much more expensive to develop the first new console microsofts xbox 2 is not expected to reach the shops until the end of 2005 games typically take at least 18 months to create however so developers are grappling with the hardware today according to robert walsh head of brisbanebased game developer krome studios next generation games will cost between 1025m to make with teams averaging 80 staff in size taking two years to complete a title such sums mean it will be difficult for anyone to start a new game studio said mr walsh if youre a startup i doubt that a publisher is going to walk in and give you a cheque for 10m however good you are he said mr walsh suggested that new studios should make games for mobile phones and handheld consoles like the sony psp and the nintendo ds since they are cheaper and easier to create than console games one developer bucking the trend towards big art teams is will wright the creator of the bestselling the sims games the founder of californias maxis studio surprised the conference with a world exclusive preview of his next game spore spore will allow players to experiment with the evolution of digital creatures starting with an amoebasized organism the player will guide the physical development of their creature by selecting how its limbs jaws and other body parts evolve eventually the creature will become capable of establishing cities trading and fighting and even building space ships advanced players will visit the home planets of creatures created by other spore players these worlds will be automatically swapped across the internet mr wright said that enabling players to devise and share their creatures would make them care more about the game i dont want to put the player in the role of luke skywalker or frodo baggins i want them to be george lucas or dr seuss explained mr wright few games have hinted at the scope of spore but mr wright explained that he has nevertheless kept his development team small by hiring expert programmers instead of employing lots of artists to create 3d models of the digital creatures spore generates and displays the creatures according to rules devised by the programmers the thing i am coming away with from the conference is that next generation content is going to be really expensive and creating it will drive the smaller players out of the market said mr wright id like to offer an alternative to that new development tools will be another important aid in making next generation games and dozens of companies demonstrated their latest products at the conference oxfordbased natural motion launched endorphin v20 which enables artists to direct a 3d virtual actor the actor is realistically modelled according to the laws of physics endorphin simulates how the actor falls down stairs for instance or crumples up after a gunshot artists can blend together these visual sequences and include the results in their games the process is much quicker than having an artist animate each movement by hand and so lessens the need for larger art teams another british company aiming to reduce the workload of artists is manchester startup genemation its latest tool gencrowd enables artists to create unique photorealistic human faces for games involving lots of people gencrowd works by blending together elements of an inbuilt supply of stock faces of differing ages and ethnicities the software can create up to 2000 new heads an hour one area not yet dominated by graphical blockbusters is mobile phone games even the latest phones are not as powerful as the consoles of a decade ago so smaller teams of half a dozen people can still create complete games for the devices the game developers conference included a special twoday summit dedicated to creating mobile games a niche attraction for a few dozen conference attendees when it began five years ago gdcs mobile summit this year drew several hundred delegates mobile games are a fastgrowing sector because newer phones have better graphics and sound and are thus more suitable for playing games furthermore the adoption of mobile phones continues to spread across the world its predicted that by 2006 two billion people will own a mobile phone the growing importance of mobile gaming was reflected by a keynote given by john batter general manager at ea mobile ea mobile is a division of electronic arts the biggest games publisher until recently electronic arts had been dismissive of games for phones the last time you checked ea wasnt in this business mr batter admitted but he said ea now planned on dominating the market by releasing mobile versions of its most popular franchises ea plans to release up to 20 mobile games over the next 12 months the first will be a version of its need for speed racing game created by ea mobiles 30person development team mr

202,brainwave cap controls computer a team of us researchers has shown that controlling devices with the brain is a step closer four people two of them partly paralysed wheelchair users successfully moved a computer cursor while wearing a cap with 64 electrodes previous research has shown that monkeys can control a computer with electrodes implanted into their brain the new york team reported their findings in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences the results show that people can learn to use scalprecorded electroencephalogram rhythms to control rapid and accurate movement of a cursor in two directions said jonathan wolpaw and dennis mcfarlane the research team from new york state department of health and state university of new york in albany said the research was another step towards people controlling wheelchairs or other electronic devices by thought the four people faced a large video screen wearing a special cap which meant no surgery or implantation was needed brain activity produces electrical signals that can be read by electrodes complex algorithms then translate those signals into instructions to direct the computer such brain activity does not require the use of any nerves of muscles so people with stroke or spinal cord injuries could use the cap effectively the impressive noninvasive multidimensional control achieved in the present study suggests that a noninvasive brain control interface could support clinically useful operation of a robotic arm a motorised wheelchair or a neuroprosthesis said the researchers the four volunteers also showed that they could get better at controlling the cursor the more times they tried although the two partiallyparalysed people performed better overall the researchers said this could be because their brains were more used to adapting or that they were simply more motivated it is not the first time researchers have had this sort of success in braincontrol experiments some teams have used eye motion and other recording techniques earlier this year a team at the mit media labs europe demonstrated a wireless cap which read brain waves to control a computer character

220,tough rules for ringtone sellers firms that flout rules on how ringtones and other mobile extras are sold could be cut off from all uk phone networks the rules allow offenders to be cut off if they do not let consumers know exactly what they get for their money and how to turn off the services the first month under the new rules has seen at least ten firms suspended while they clean up the way they work the rules have been brought in to ensure that the problems plaguing net users do not spread to mobile phones in the last couple of years ringtones wallpapers screensavers and lots of other extras for phones have become hugely popular but fierce competition is making it difficult for firms to get their wares in front of consumers said jeremy flynn head of third party services at vodafone if you are not on the operators portal you are going to have quite heavy marketing costs because its a problem of how people discover your services he said to combat this many ringtone and other mobile content sellers started using a new tactic to squeeze more cash out of customers this tactic involved signing people up for a subscription to give them for instance several ringtones per week or month instead of the single track they thought they were getting mr flynn said that the move to using subscriptions happened over the space of a few weeks at the end of 2004 websites such as grumbletextcouk started getting reports from customers who were racking up large bills for phone content they did not know they had signed up for what made us uncomfortable was that these services were not being marketed transparently said mr flynn people did not know they were being offered a subscription service we saw potential for substantial consumer harm here he added the swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones the drafting of the new rules was led by the mobile entertainment forum and the uks phone firms everyone is required to conform to this code of conduct said andrew bud regulatory head of the mef and executive chairman of messaging firm mblox its all about transparency he said consumers have to be told what they have got themselves into and how to get out of it the consumer has a right to be protected he said christian harris partnership manager of mobile content firm zed said the new system was essential if consumers were to trust companies that sell ringtones and other downloads the groundrules must be applied across the whole industry and if thats done effectively we will see the cowboys driven out he said the new rules came in to force on 15 january and the first month under the new regime has seen many firms cautioned for not honouring them some have been told to revamp websites so customers know what they get for their money and what they are signing up for said mr flynn also said mr flynn vodafone has briefly cut off between eight and ten content sellers flouting the rules we have quite draconian contracts with firms he said we do not have to say why we can just cut them off under the rules consumers must be able to switch off the services by using a universal stop command sent via text message he said the system had been designed to limit how much a consumer will pay if they inadvertently signed up for a service the mobile is so personal that people really resent the abuse of what is effectively part of their personality said mr flynn

227,rings of steel combat net attacks gambling is hugely popular especially with techsavvy criminals many extortionists are targeting netbased betting firms and threatening to cripple their websites with deluges of data unless a ransom is paid but now deep defences are being put in place by some of the uks biggest net firms to stop these attacks increasing numbers of attacks and the huge amounts of data being used to try to bump a site off the web are prompting firms to adopt the measures net firms are realising that its not just about antivirus and firewalls said paul king chief security architect at cisco there are more things that can be done in the network to protect data centres mr king said the only way to properly combat these socalled distributed denialofservice attacks was with intelligent netbased systems many of the gambling sites suffering ddos attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting said mr king this overspill effect was only likely to grow as attacks grow in size and scale malcolm seagrave security expert at energis said the most common types of attacks hit sites with 10 megabytes of data over short periods of time bigger attacks sending down 200 megabytes of traffic or more were rarely seen he said it does feel like they are turning the dial because you see this traffic gradually growing he said so far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data said mr seagrave however he added that it was only a matter of time before such large attacks were mounted maria capella spokeswoman for net provider pipex said that when ddos attacks were at their height customers were getting hit every four to five days the defences being put in place constantly monitor the streams of data flowing across networks and pluck out the traffic destined for target sites its about understanding whats genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site she said we study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile thats when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack said ms capella this traffic can be hard to spot because ddos attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data flood typically these computers have been infected by a virus or worm which reports its success and the net address of compromised machines back to the malicious hacker or hitech criminal that set off the virus hijacked computers are known as zombies or bots and collections of them are called bot nets many spammers rent out bot nets to help them anonymously send junk mail most of the zombies are based outside the country that hosts the target site so getting the attacking pcs shut off can be difficult often pipex and other net suppliers do get advance notice that an attack is about to happen the serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom email said ms capella we ask as part of the service we provide that customers notify us of anything they have in advance that would give us forewarning once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay up energis took a similar approach said mr seagrave we have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together said mr seagrave also net firms were starting to work more closely together on the problem of ddos attacks and pool information about where they are coming from information gathered on attacks and where they originated has led to some arrests he said energis also did its own intelligence work to get in insight into which sites criminal gangs plan to target we have people in places where they shouldnt be monitoring tech sites he said sometimes though he said spotting the next victim was easy you can see them going alphabetically through the list with the gambling sites trying one after another said mr seagrave
